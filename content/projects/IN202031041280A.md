## Abstract

The system discloses an Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with a radio communication module (SDR) to emulate a cellular base station and has a persistent connection to a ground control unit which directs and navigates said UAVs. The radio communication equipment acts as an IMSI catcher, resulting in nearby cellular devices to latch onto it as cellular devices poll all base stations in the vicinity. The cellular handset provides the base station with basic identification information such as the IMEI and IMSI numbers, which the UAV can retransmit to the base station along with its coordinates and the signal level of connected handsets. The ground control unit then uses true-range multilateration techniques, using the data (signal strength of handset and coordinates of UAV) from multiple UAVs, thus enabling the operator to pinpoint the position of individual handsets.
